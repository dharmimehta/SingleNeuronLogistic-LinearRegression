# SingleNeuronLogistic-LinearRegression

• Apply deep learning thinking in modeling a single neuron to build logistic regression and linear
regression models.
• Apply the idea of vectorization to efficiently train your models.
• Implement gradient descent from scratch (using multiple iterations of the forward pass,
backward propagation, and gradient descent steps) to minimize the loss functions and
determine model parameters.
